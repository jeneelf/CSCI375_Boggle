# Code Review Feedback Summary

In my code review, minor improvement suggestions were made regarding the handling of single-character cases, particularly letters like **'U'** and **'T'**. This feedback emphasized the importance of managing edge cases where single characters might otherwise be overlooked or misinterpreted by my tile-handling logic. Addressing this issue helped prevent the mishandling of single letters within the code.

The reviewer also recommended that I consider switching to uppercase rather than lowercase characters, though this was noted as optional. This change streamlined the code by standardizing character comparisons, reducing case-related errors, and ensuring consistency. Switching to uppercase made the code easier to read, with consistent formatting that prevents minor issues related to case mismatches.

Although not explicitly mentioned, making these changes was likely to improve the readability and maintainability of my code. By managing single cases more explicitly, sticking with a consistent case format, and maintaining clear logic around special tiles, I aimed to make the code structure simpler to understand. These improvements would also help ensure the code remains easier to maintain in the long term, especially if future contributors need to understand or modify it.


# Conclusion

In summary, the feedback I received provided clear steps to improve the robustness and readability of my code. By enhancing single-character handling, maintaining the existing logic for special tiles, and considering a consistent case format, I aimed to make my code more resilient to edge cases and easier to maintain. Implementing these suggestions strengthened the code and ensured it met all requirements effectively.
